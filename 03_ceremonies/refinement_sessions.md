# 🧩 Refinement Sessions

**Refinement Sessions** break down work across three levels — from strategic intent to daily execution. Each level has its own purpose, format, and facilitator. These sessions ensure that only clear, deliverable work enters the sprint.

Refinement is where risk is removed _before_ delivery begins.

> 📌 These are working sessions — not discussion groups. Each level of refinement produces a clear outcome and advances work closer to "Ready."

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Clarify and shape work before it’s planned
- Align on outcomes and scope at each level
- Surface blockers, unknowns, and risks early
- Protect the sprint from unclear or oversized work

---

## ⏱️ Timing

Refinement is split into three structured sessions, held every sprint:

| Session               | When                       | Duration                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Strategic Refinement  | Every Monday               | 45 minutes                               |
| Functional Refinement | Every Wednesday            | 45 minutes                               |
| Tactical Refinement   | Immediately after Planning | 30 minutes per Developer (self-directed) |

## 👥 Participants

| Session               | Facilitator          | Key Participants                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Strategic Refinement  | Scope Coordinator    | Scope Leads, Scrum Master (optional) |
| Functional Refinement | Scope Lead           | Developers, Product Analyst          |
| Tactical Refinement   | Developer (self-led) | —                                    |

## 🔁 Ceremony Flow

Each session follows a consistent structure based on the level of work being refined.

---

### 🧭 Strategic Refinement

**Goal**: Break down Projects into scoped Epics and Features.

**Flow**:

1. Scope Coordinator presents proposed Projects, Epics, or Features
2. Team clarifies intent, size, value
3. Epics are approved or returned for revision
4. Features are drafted or validated
5. Backlog is updated and prioritized

**Expected Output**:  
Ready Epics and Features with measurable outcomes, linked to Projects

---

### 📓 Functional Refinement

**Goal**: Define testable, sprint-sized User Stories based on Features.

**Flow**:

1. Scope Lead selects Features to break down
2. Team drafts or reviews User Stories
3. Analyst supports writing acceptance criteria
4. Developers provide feedback on technical feasibility
5. Stories are estimated and marked `Ready`

**Expected Output**:  
User Stories that meet readiness standards for Planning

---

### 🔧 Tactical Refinement

**Goal**: Break assigned Stories into day-sized Tasks.

**Flow**:

1. Each Developer reviews their committed Stories
2. Developer creates Tasks (2–5 per Story, 1 day max each)
3. Tasks are assigned, described, and moved to `Ready`
4. Scrum Master verifies that all Stories are fully decomposed

**Expected Output**:  
Each Story is broken into clear, trackable, executable Tasks

---

## ✅ Shared Guidelines

- Each session has a single facilitator — refinement is not “team free talk”
- Preparation is expected — unprepared work is skipped
- Only work that meets readiness standards is marked `Ready`
- Anything unclear, oversized, or blocked is flagged for follow-up

---

## 👍 Good Practices

- Keep discussions structured — focus on outcomes, not ideas
- End each session with visible backlog updates
- Ask "What’s missing?" or "What would block this?" at every level
- Use naming patterns and clarity standards for all work items

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Refining work during Planning
- Jumping straight to Stories without defining Features
- Leaving Stories unestimated or unbroken
- Using Tactical Refinement to write new logic or rethink scope

---

Refinement is how work becomes deliverable.  
Every Story that flows smoothly started as a well-run refinement session.
