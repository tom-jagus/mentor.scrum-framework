# 📣 Daily Standup

**Daily Standup** is a short, structured check-in that keeps the team aligned, maintains momentum, and surfaces blockers early. It is not a status report — it’s a visibility loop focused on Task-level execution.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Review progress and identify anything blocked
- Update the Scrum board to reflect real-time status
- Reinforce team focus and shared accountability
- Enable quick intervention before issues escalate

---

## ⏱️ Timing

- **When**: Every working day
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Facilitator**: Scrum Master
- **Cadence**: Daily

---

## 👥 Participants

- Entire team (mandatory)
- Scrum Master facilitates
- Developers and Analysts speak to their current work

---

## 🔁 Ceremony Flow

1. **Review the Board**  
   The Scrum Master walks the board left-to-right (`Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done`), by column or swimlane.

2. **Discuss Active Work**  
   Each Developer speaks briefly about Tasks currently `In Progress`.

3. **Identify Blockers**  
   Any item in `Blocked` must be raised and explained. Scrum Master logs and triages escalations.

4. **Clarify Priorities**  
   If multiple Tasks are active, the team confirms what’s most important to finish first.

5. **Close Out**  
   Scrum Master captures actions, and team updates Task statuses (if not already done).

## ✅ Participation Guidelines

Each team member is expected to:

- Update their Task status before Standup
- Speak only to Tasks that are in motion (not everything assigned)
- Surface blockers clearly and early
- Respect the time limit — follow-up conversations happen after

---

## 🏁 Expected Outputs

By the end of each Standup:

- Blockers are known and owned
- Task statuses on the board reflect reality
- The team is clear on today’s priorities
- No untracked or invisible work remains

---

## 👍 Good Practices

- Keep it board-driven — not person-by-person updates
- Be specific: “This Task is blocked by X,” not “Still working on it”
- Say “I need help” early — that’s the point of Standup
- Let the board do the storytelling

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Using Standup to report hours spent
- Talking about everything assigned, not just what’s active
- Leaving blockers unmentioned or unresolved
- Waiting until Standup to update the board

---

Standup is not about speaking — it’s about syncing.  
The goal isn’t to talk — it’s to move work forward.
