# 🔁 Ceremonies Overview

Ceremonies are the team’s structured, time-based rituals. They create rhythm, reinforce focus, and ensure that planning, execution, and reflection happen consistently across the sprint cycle.

Each ceremony serves a specific purpose — from selecting what to build, to unblocking execution, to reviewing outcomes and improving how the team works.

> 📌 Ceremonies are not for status reporting. They exist to align people, focus effort, and support delivery flow.

## 🧭 Why We Use Ceremonies

- Enable clear and consistent sprint rhythm
- Create structured moments for collaboration and decision-making
- Reduce ambiguity around priorities, blockers, and expectations
- Reinforce shared accountability and team-owned delivery

Ceremonies are lightweight by design — not bureaucratic checkpoints, but focused routines that support flow and clarity.

## 🔄 Ceremonies List

Each ceremony has a dedicated file with full structure, roles, flow, and best practices. Below is a high-level summary of what each ceremony is for.

### 🧭 Sprint Planning

Select and commit to sprint work based on team capacity, readiness, and business priorities.  
The team defines a Sprint Goal, pulls refined Stories, and confirms who owns what. Planning is not for refining — only for committing.

### 📣 Daily Standup

Keep the team aligned and unblock delivery.  
Focus is on Task-level movement: What’s being worked, what’s blocked, and what’s ready to review. Standup is fast, factual, and board-driven.

### 🔍 Sprint Review & Retrospective

Close the sprint by looking back at both delivery and process.  
Review confirms that work meets the Sprint Goal and acceptance criteria. Retrospective reflects on what helped, what slowed us down, and what we’ll improve next.

### 🧩 Refinement Sessions

Clarify and de-risk work before it’s planned:

- **Strategic Refinement**: Break down Projects into scoped Epics and Features
- **Functional Refinement**: Define testable, sprint-sized User Stories
- **Tactical Refinement**: Turn Stories into day-sized Tasks immediately after Planning

## 🧠 Ceremony Guidelines

- Each ceremony has a facilitator (typically the Scrum Master or a designated role)
- Agendas are consistent but flexible — clarity and participation matter more than formality
- Preparation is required — ceremonies without preparation waste time and reduce sprint success
- Outputs must be visible — every ceremony should result in updated boards, priorities, or decisions

---

Ceremonies give structure to the sprint — not by controlling people, but by enabling clarity, commitment, and continuous improvement.
