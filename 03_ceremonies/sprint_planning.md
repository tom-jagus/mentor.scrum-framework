# 🧭 Sprint Planning

**Sprint Planning** defines what the team will deliver over the next two weeks. It ensures that work is selected intentionally, scoped realistically, and aligned with both team capacity and business priorities.

This ceremony converts refined Stories into a committed Sprint Goal — creating a shared plan for delivery.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Define a clear, achievable Sprint Goal
- Select Stories that are refined, estimated, and ready
- Confirm team capacity and adjust expectations accordingly
- Align on Story ownership and expected outcomes

---

## ⏱️ Timing

- **When**: Last Thursday of each sprint
- **Duration**: 1.5 hours
- **Cadence**: Every 2 weeks (mandatory)
- **Facilitator**: Scrum Master

---

## 👥 Participants

- Entire team (mandatory)
- Scrum Master facilitates
- Scope Lead presents refined Stories
- Product Owner may attend to reinforce priorities

---

## 🔁 Ceremony Flow

1. **Set the Context**  
   Scrum Master or Scope Coordinator restates key priorities and the current delivery focus.

2. **Confirm Capacity**  
   Team members declare any time-off or capacity constraints. Scrum Master adjusts total team availability.

3. **Review Ready Stories**  
   Scope Lead presents refined Stories. Developers ask clarifying questions if needed.

4. **Estimate (if needed)**  
   Any unestimated Stories are reviewed and sized.

5. **Select Work**  
   Team pulls Stories into the sprint until ~80% capacity is filled.

6. **Define the Sprint Goal**  
   Sprint Goal is either linked to a Feature or written to describe expected outcomes.

7. **Assign Initial Ownership**  
   Each Developer confirms ownership of one or more Stories.

8. **Close Out**  
   The board is updated. Sprint officially starts the following day.

## ✅ Readiness Requirements

Only Stories that are **fully Ready** can be included in Sprint Planning. Each Story must:

- Be linked to a Feature
- Have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- Contain no blockers or unknowns
- Be refined and understood by the team
- Be small enough to complete within one sprint

---

## 🏁 Expected Outputs

By the end of Sprint Planning:

- A Sprint Goal is agreed upon and documented
- Stories are selected and assigned to owners
- The board is populated with `Ready` Stories
- Developers begin Tactical Refinement for their assigned work

---

## 👍 Good Practices

- Always leave buffer (20%) for bugs, support, and blockers
- Speak up if a Story feels unclear — unclear work leads to rework
- Push back on “just-in-case” work — Planning is for commitment, not speculation
- Review Story size and total scope as a team, not individually

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Selecting Stories that haven’t been refined
- Overcommitting without considering team availability
- Using Planning to write or define Stories
- Skipping Tactical Refinement after Planning

---

Sprint Planning is not about predicting velocity — it’s about making clear, intentional commitments the team can deliver on.
