# 🔍 Sprint Review & Retrospective

**Sprint Review & Retrospective** is a two-part ceremony that closes each sprint. It validates what was delivered (Review), and reflects on how the team worked (Retrospective). This ensures we’re not just delivering work — we’re continuously improving how we deliver it.

> 📌 This ceremony is focused on outcomes — not activity. It’s where we confirm value, collect feedback, and commit to small, intentional improvements.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Validate Stories against expectations and acceptance criteria

## 🔁 Ceremony Flow

### Part 1 — Sprint Review

1. **Set the Context**  
   Scrum Master restates the Sprint Goal and key Feature focus areas.

2. **Present Completed Stories**  
   Scope Lead presents the Stories one by one. Developers may provide supporting details where needed.

3. **Confirm Acceptance**  
   Product Analyst confirms acceptance criteria are met.  
   Product Owner confirms that outcomes meet intent and expectations.

4. **Capture Feedback**  
   Any misalignments, missed outcomes, or improvement ideas are logged for discussion or follow-up.

### Part 2 — Retrospective

1. **Quick Check-In**  
   What helped this sprint? What slowed us down?

2. **Identify Patterns**  
   Look for recurring blockers, scope issues, or process gaps.

3. **Commit to Improvements**  
   The team agrees on 1–2 specific, testable changes to try next sprint.

## ✅ Readiness Requirements

Only work that is **truly complete** should be included in Review:

- Status is `Done`
- Meets all acceptance criteria
- Validated by the responsible Developer or Analyst
- Demonstrable without caveats

---

## 🏁 Expected Outputs

- Completed Stories have been reviewed and validated
- Product Owner confirms alignment to Sprint Goal
- Retrospective actions are captured (1–2 max)
- Team alignment is reset for the next sprint

---

## 👍 Good Practices

- Keep Story presentations short and structured — focus on outcomes
- Limit Retrospective scope — improvement is more important than expression
- Document what worked — not just what went wrong
- Revisit previous actions — track progress on continuous improvement

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Demoing unfinished or unvalidated work
- Turning Retrospective into a status meeting or emotional dump
- Repeating the same observations without action
- Having every team member present — Scope Lead should drive with support from Developers

---

Review validates the _what_. Retrospective improves the _how_.  
Together, they close the loop and sharpen the next sprint.
