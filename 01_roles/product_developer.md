# 🛠️ Product Developer

The Product Developer builds the work. This role owns the implementation of User Stories and Tasks, turning planned scope into working solutions.

The focus is on clarity, progress, and delivery — not just writing code, but making sure the team finishes what was committed with quality and transparency.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Translate well-defined User Stories into working, tested, and documented outputs. The Product Developer ensures delivery is traceable, blockers are visible, and outcomes meet acceptance criteria.

---

## 🔑 Responsibilities

- Review and commit to User Stories during Sprint Planning
- Break Stories into executable Tasks during Tactical Refinement
- Implement and test each Task with clarity and quality
- Maintain the Scrum board (statuses, blockers, updates)
- Raise risks and dependencies as early as possible
- Participate actively in ceremonies, retrospectives, and peer collaboration

## 🔁 Ceremony Involvement

| Ceremony                  | Participation | Role in Ceremony                                            |

| **Strategic Refinement**  | Informed      | May attend to understand direction or context               |
| **Functional Refinement** | Responsible   | Provides technical input on Story feasibility               |
| **Tactical Refinement**   | Accountable   | Breaks Stories into Tasks and prepares for sprint execution |
| **Sprint Planning**       | Responsible   | Accepts Stories and estimates effort                        |
| **Daily Standup**         | Active        | Shares progress, raises blockers, updates Task status       |
| **Sprint Review**         | Participant   | Supports demonstration and answers implementation questions |
| **Retrospective**         | Participant   | Contributes observations and improvement ideas              |

## 📦 Backlog Scope

- Owns:
  - **Tasks** (definition, status, quality)
  - **User Stories** (implementation ownership once accepted)
- Supports:
  - **Bug handling** (co-owned with Product Analyst)
  - **Refinement** (provides implementation insights and complexity estimates)

The Product Developer doesn’t define work — they make sure it gets delivered with transparency and technical integrity.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Touchpoints

- Works with the **Scope Lead** to clarify Stories and track sprint progress
- Collaborates with the **Product Analyst** to validate deliverables and report bugs
- Partners with the **Scrum Master** to surface blockers and improve flow
- Provides feedback in refinement to improve future Story quality

## 📊 RACI — Product Developer

| Activity                            | Responsibility |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Break Stories into executable Tasks | **A/R**        |
| Deliver and test Tasks              | **A/R**        |
| Raise and track blockers            | **R**          |
| Update Scrum board                  | **R**          |
| Support bug handling                | **A/R**        |
| Join Sprint ceremonies              | **R**          |

Legend:

- **A** = Accountable
- **R** = Responsible
- **C** = Consulted
- **I** = Informed

---

## 🧠 Reminders

- If something isn’t clear, raise it — silence creates blockers
- Keep Tasks small, testable, and traceable
- You don’t just write code — you deliver finished, validated work

This role turns planning into progress. No matter how clean the Story, nothing moves forward until it’s built, tested, and done.
