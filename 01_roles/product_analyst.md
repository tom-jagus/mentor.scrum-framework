# 🧪 Product Analyst

The Product Analyst ensures quality, clarity, and feedback. This role supports delivery by validating outputs, clarifying needs, and connecting the team with real user expectations.

The focus is on outcomes — not just whether something was built, but whether it works as intended and makes sense to end users.

- Validate delivered work against acceptance criteria
- Raise bugs or misalignments for triage and rework

## 🧠 Reminders

- Validation isn’t just testing — it’s confirming intent, clarity, and usefulness
- If it’s unclear to test, it probably wasn’t ready to build
- Raise bugs clearly, early, and constructively — quality is a shared outcome

This role ensures that work is complete, usable, and aligned with what actually matters. Done is only done when it works — for real users.
