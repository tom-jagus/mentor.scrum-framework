# ✅ Work Item Checklists

Each work item must meet specific criteria before being accepted into a sprint or marked as done. These checklists provide a shared definition of readiness and completeness at every level of work.

> 📌 Use these during refinement, sprint planning, and review to ensure consistent standards and delivery quality.
