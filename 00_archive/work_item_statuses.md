# 🔄 Work Item Statuses

Each work item type has its own set of lifecycle statuses that reflect progress, visibility, and delivery readiness. These statuses drive board design, reporting, and daily operations.

All statuses are represented on the Scrum board using standardized columns or state fields. Items must never be left in ambiguous or outdated states.

## 📌 Usage Guidelines

- Statuses are updated **daily** by the item owner or assignee
- **Blocked items** must be surfaced immediately and reviewed in standup
- Items stuck in a non-terminal state for >2 days should be flagged
- The **Scrum Master** monitors status flow and WIP trends across the board

Statuses make the work visible. They aren’t just for tracking — they support clear decision-making and help the team move forward with confidence.
