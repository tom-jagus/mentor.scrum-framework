# 🧭 Strategic Refinement Guide

Strategic Refinement is how the team aligns strategic intent with actual delivery. It ensures that Projects, Epics, and Features are clearly defined, appropriately sized, and ready to be broken down into work.

> 📌 This session protects the team from chaos by shaping the “top of the funnel” — what’s worth delivering, and why.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Define or refine Epics and Features based on strategic goals
- Break down Projects into manageable Epics
- Ensure Features are clear, scoped, and connected to measurable outcomes
- Maintain a structured backlog aligned to business priorities

## ⏱️ When It Happens

- **Every Monday**
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Cadence**: Weekly, required

---

## 🔁 Session Flow

1. **Preparation**

   - Scope Coordinator selects new or updated Projects, Epics, or Features for review
   - Bring notes from previous reviews or Product Owner conversations

2. **Set the context**

   - Revisit current delivery goals
   - Call out newly proposed initiatives or changes

3. **Work top-down**

   - For new Projects → Define Epic themes and initial outcomes
   - For new Epics → Write measurable outcomes and link to Projects
   - For Features → Size, clarify, and connect to Epics

4. **Gate check**

   - Use Readiness Checklist (below)
   - Only move `Ready` Epics and Features forward

5. **Update backlog**

   - Re-prioritize based on urgency and value
   - Assign owners for next-step decomposition

6. **Wrap up**
   - Summarize what moved forward
   - Flag unclear or abandoned items for cleanup

## 📋 Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Epic is `Ready` if:

- [ ] Linked to an approved Project
- [ ] Describes a clear, measurable outcome
- [ ] Contains at least one supporting Feature
- [ ] Sized for 1–3 months of delivery
- [ ] Reviewed by Scope Coordinator and Scope Lead

### ✅ Feature is `Ready` if:

- [ ] Supports a specific Epic
- [ ] Scoped for 1–2 sprints
- [ ] Describes purpose, goal, and outcome
- [ ] Has no major technical ambiguity
- [ ] Reviewed and approved for Functional Refinement

## ✏️ Writing Clear Epic & Feature

### 🔹 Epic

**Core Principles**

- Focus on a high-level business outcome or capability
- Tie directly to a Project or strategic goal
- Leave room for multiple Features to support delivery

**Writing Patterns**

- _“Enable [user/team] to [achieve outcome] through [capability or service]”_

**Good Examples**

- ✅ “Enable self-service SLA reporting for service managers”
- ✅ “Establish baseline cost metrics for cross-region incident management”

**Bad Examples**

- ❌ “Reporting redesign”
- ❌ “Performance tracking updates”

---

### 🔹 Feature

**Core Principles**

- Describe a specific, high-value deliverable
- Sized for completion within 1–2 sprints
- Focused on _what’s being delivered_, not _how it will be implemented_

**Writing Patterns**

- _“Add [functionality or improvement] to [product or process]”_
- _“Create [component or tool] that enables [user task or visibility]”_

**Good Examples**

- ✅ “Add SLA thresholds and compliance flags to KPI dashboard”
- ✅ “Build export function for incident SLA breaches”

**Bad Examples**

- ❌ “Work on SLA logic”
- ❌ “Fix export system”

## 🧠 Facilitation Tips (for Scope Coordinators)

- Always ask: _“Why now?”_ — if there's no urgency or value, push it back
- Use Epics to give structure — not to track effort
- Don’t try to define every detail — get to “clear enough to break down”
- Ask Scope Leads to validate feasibility based on past velocity

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I skip Strategic Refinement if I already know what the team should do?**  
A: No — without structured breakdown, Stories appear without context or alignment. Strategic refinement prevents top-down chaos.

**Q: What if the Product Owner hasn’t defined priorities yet?**  
A: Work with what's already in motion. Use the session to validate or rework backlog quality so it’s ready when priorities arrive.

**Q: How do I know if a Feature is too big?**  
A: If it can’t be delivered in 2 sprints, or has more than 5–6 user-facing elements, it likely needs to be split.

**Q: Can we define Stories here too?**  
A: No — this session ends at the Feature level. User Stories are handled in Functional Refinement.
