# ⚙️ Processes Overview

This section defines the team’s core operational processes — how we coordinate, track, and protect delivery. Each process is lightweight but essential: it enables clarity, prevents rework, and supports shared accountability.

Use this file to get a high-level understanding of how the team works. Each entry covers:

- 📌 Purpose — why the process exists
- ⏱️ When it applies — cadence, triggers, or situations
- ⚠️ Risks if ignored — what tends to go wrong without it

---

### 📂 Backlog Governance

- **Purpose**: Keep the backlog clean, prioritized, and owned — from top-level strategy to sprint-level delivery.
- **When It Applies**: Weekly for Stories; monthly for Epics and Projects.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Stale or duplicate items accumulate; unclear priorities distort planning.

---

### 🐞 Bug Handling

- **Purpose**: Treat Bugs as first-class work items with proper triage, validation, prioritization, and delivery standards.
- **When It Applies**: Whenever a defect is reported that breaks expected functionality or acceptance criteria.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Fixes are undocumented, regressions are missed, and validation becomes unreliable.

---

### 📌 Definition of Ready & Done

- **Purpose**: Create a shared contract for when work is ready to begin — and when it’s truly done.
- **When It Applies**: During refinement, planning, daily execution, and sprint review.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Unclear work enters the sprint; incomplete work is closed early; accountability breaks down.

---

### 🚦 Escalation Handling

- **Purpose**: Ensure blockers, delivery risks, and misalignments are surfaced, tracked, and resolved with ownership.
- **When It Applies**: Any time an issue arises that cannot be resolved within the sprint team or delays delivery.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Silent blockers derail work; ownership is unclear; escalations happen too late to recover.

---

### 🌐 External Dependency Tracking

- **Purpose**: Ensure all work that relies on other teams, systems, or vendors is tracked, followed up, and escalated as needed.
- **When It Applies**: Whenever progress depends on input, approval, or delivery from outside the sprint team.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Blockers stay hidden, handoffs are missed, and timelines slip without visibility.

---

### 📝 Meeting Notes & Decisions

- **Purpose**: Capture decisions, action items, and context from discussions — even informal ones — to support follow-through.
- **When It Applies**: Any meeting involving planning, delivery clarification, stakeholder alignment, or decisions.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Team members forget outcomes, miscommunicate scope, or repeat unresolved debates.

---

### 🔄 Non-Project Work

- **Purpose**: Classify and control work that doesn’t fit into formal Projects — including support, maintenance, and ad hoc tasks.
- **When It Applies**: During planning, intake, and throughout the sprint whenever unstructured work appears.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Scope drift, invisible work, and overcommitment from untracked tasks.

---

### 📆 Sprint Cadence

- **Purpose**: Maintain a predictable, repeatable sprint structure so the team can plan, deliver, and reflect with confidence.
- **When It Applies**: Always — this cadence is fixed and applies to all ceremonies and refinement loops.
- **Risks if Ignored**: Meetings drift, priorities shift mid-sprint, and delivery rhythm breaks down.

---

### 📊 WIP Limits & Delivery Metrics

- **Purpose**: Protect delivery flow with clear WIP limits and reflect on team health through meaningful metrics.
- **When It Applies**: Daily (WIP enforcement); weekly/monthly (metrics review in Review or Retro).
- **Risks if Ignored**: Work stalls midstream, overcommitment increases, and improvement becomes guesswork.

Processes don’t slow us down — they keep us aligned.  
Clarity is not overhead. It’s how we move faster together.
