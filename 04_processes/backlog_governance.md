# 📂 Backlog Governance

The backlog is not a dumping ground — it’s the active memory of the team.  
This process defines how we maintain backlog quality, ownership, and structure across all levels of work.

> 📌 A clean backlog prevents planning debt, scope confusion, and delivery drift.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Ensure the backlog reflects only valid, valuable, and well-structured work
- Assign ownership to maintain and prioritize each part of the backlog
- Prevent buildup of stale, unclear, or duplicate items
- Support predictable, informed planning and prioritization

---

## 🧭 What “Backlog” Includes

This process applies to all work in the system, including:

- Projects, Epics, Features
- User Stories, Tasks, Bugs
- Non-project work (support, maintenance, exploratory)
- Any tracked item with a potential delivery outcome

## 👥 Ownership by Work Type

| Work Item      | Primary Owner     | Maintenance Responsibility                |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Project**    | Product Owner     | Product Owner + Scope Coordinator         |
| **Epic**       | Scope Coordinator | Scope Coordinator                         |
| **Feature**    | Scope Coordinator | Scope Coordinator                         |
| **User Story** | Scope Lead        | Scope Lead + Product Developer (feedback) |
| **Task**       | Product Developer | Product Developer                         |
| **Bug**        | Product Analyst   | Product Analyst + Developer (fix)         |

Each owner is responsible for:

- Keeping status accurate
- Merging duplicates
- Cleaning out outdated or abandoned items
- Ensuring refinement loops are triggered as needed

## 🧹 Hygiene & Maintenance Rules

| Practice                    | Description                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stale Work Cleanup**      | Items untouched for >2 sprints should be reviewed or removed       |
| **Duplicate Consolidation** | Merge related work under a single item with clear outcomes         |
| **Obsolete Scope Removal**  | Items no longer needed or valid are closed with a comment          |
| **Backlog Review Cadence**  | Weekly: Scope Leads + Scrum Master review top-of-backlog readiness |
| **Priority Revalidation**   | Monthly: Coordinators and PO re-align top-level delivery focus     |

## 🧭 Readiness Checks

Before moving any item into Planning or Refinement:

- Is it still relevant?
- Is it owned?
- Is it sized appropriately for refinement or delivery?
- Does it belong in the current sprint horizon?

If not, it should be deferred, revised, or closed.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Keep the top of the backlog short, current, and prioritized
- Archive what you don’t want to delete — visible doesn’t mean active
- Add context to every item: who asked for it, what it solves, how it will be used
- Use tags or categories consistently to support filtering and views

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Leaving old Stories and Features to “maybe use later”
- Allowing different roles to define the same work in parallel
- Letting Bugs or spikes accumulate without purpose
- Using the backlog as a brainstorm wall

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How often should we clean the backlog?**  
Every sprint at the Story level, monthly at the Epic level. Think of it as part of refinement — not separate work.

**Q: What if someone outside the team adds unclear work?**  
The owner reviews it. If it’s unclear or unowned, it’s flagged or removed after 2 sprints.

**Q: Can we keep large lists of “someday” work?**  
Only if clearly tagged and maintained. Otherwise, it creates planning noise and distraction.

**Q: Who decides if something is obsolete?**  
The owner of the item, in coordination with the Scope Lead or PO. Obsolete doesn’t mean “bad” — it just means it’s no longer needed.

A healthy backlog keeps the team focused on what matters — and not distracted by what doesn’t.
