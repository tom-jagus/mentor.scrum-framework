# üîÑ Non-Project Work

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> This structure represents a proposed approach to handling non-project work.  
> It is subject to further discussion and refinement by the team before being finalized.

Not all valuable work falls under a formal Project. This process defines how to classify, track, and plan **non-project work** ‚Äî including support, maintenance, ad hoc tasks, and exploratory efforts.

By treating this work with the same structure and visibility as project delivery, the team avoids scope drift, protects planning integrity, and reinforces trust.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Ensure all effort is visible ‚Äî even outside Projects
- Prevent unplanned work from derailing delivery
- Define work types, tagging rules, and prioritization behaviors
- Create balance between new development and team maintenance

## üìÇ Work Classifications

| Type             | Description                                                      | Common Examples                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Support Work** | Time-sensitive tasks unrelated to project delivery               | SLA escalations, quick data fixes, user requests    |
| **Maintenance**  | Updates to keep existing solutions usable, stable, and supported | Dependency updates, design tweaks, logic cleanup    |
| **Exploratory**  | Research, testing, or PoCs to inform future delivery decisions   | Tech spikes, data investigations, feasibility tests |
| **Ad Hoc**       | Unplanned requests or favors that don‚Äôt fit above                | ‚ÄúCan you export this one thing?‚Äù, short-term asks   |

## üß≠ Handling Rules

- All non-project work must be tracked with a proper **Work Item**
- Each item must be classified by **type** using a tag, swimlane, or label
- Items must follow the same **definition, checklist, and validation** rules as Stories or Tasks
- Scope should be reviewed and confirmed by the **Scrum Master or Scope Lead**
- Exploratory work requires a clearly defined **goal and timebox** before it begins

## üîÑ Planning & Prioritization

| Work Type    | Planning Behavior                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Support Work | May enter sprint mid-cycle if escalated; tracked separately        |
| Maintenance  | Planned intentionally in each sprint (capacity permitting)         |
| Exploratory  | Timeboxed and planned like a Story; reviewed for outcomes later    |
| Ad Hoc       | Tracked, but deprioritized unless tied to a stakeholder commitment |

Non-project work should **not exceed 20‚Äì25% of sprint capacity** unless otherwise agreed by the team.

---

## üìä Visibility

- Tracked on the board like all other Stories or Tasks
- Tagged by type and linked to owner for accountability
- May use separate swimlanes or filters depending on board setup
- Reviewed in Sprint Review if delivered; discussed in Retro if recurring

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns

- Skipping planning by labeling it "just a quick fix"
- Handling support tasks outside the board or in chat only
- Starting exploratory work without a timebox or success criteria
- Letting Ad Hoc work consume more than 25% of sprint time

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: What‚Äôs the difference between Maintenance and Support?**  
Support is reactive and time-sensitive. Maintenance is proactive and planned.

**Q: Can I do Ad Hoc work if I have sprint bandwidth?**  
Only if agreed with the Scrum Master or Scope Lead. All work still needs to be tracked and visible.

**Q: What happens if support work derails the sprint?**  
Surface it during Retro. If it‚Äôs a recurring problem, the team may need a buffer policy or rotating support schedule.

**Q: Who decides if Exploratory work is valuable?**  
The Scope Coordinator or Product Owner confirms value. Exploratory work without a purpose is not delivery ‚Äî it's distraction.

Non-project work is still real work.  
Handled with structure, it keeps systems healthy and the team adaptable.
