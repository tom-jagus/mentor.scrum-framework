# 🌐 External Dependency Tracking

External dependencies are any blockers, approvals, or deliverables outside the team’s direct control. This process ensures they are tracked, communicated, and escalated transparently — so they don’t silently delay progress or disrupt delivery.

> 📌 Dependencies aren’t the problem — hiding them is.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Make external blockers and handoffs visible
- Ensure accountability for follow-ups and expected responses
- Reduce delays from forgotten requests or misaligned expectations
- Maintain realistic sprint planning and delivery integrity

## 🧭 What Counts as an External Dependency?

| Type                   | Examples                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team-to-Team**       | Waiting on data or implementation from another internal team                 |
| **Cross-Functional**   | Pending approval, input, or testing from non-dev roles (Security, Legal, PM) |
| **Vendor or Platform** | Blocked by service providers, tool access, or integration limits             |
| **Stakeholder Input**  | Decision needed from Product Owner, management, or business owner            |

If your progress depends on someone or something outside your sprint team — it’s an external dependency.

## 🔄 How to Track It

Every external dependency must be represented visibly using one of the following:

- A flagged Task or Bug within a User Story
- A stand-alone Work Item labeled as “external” or “waiting”
- A blocker status and a clear description of who/what is needed

Each item must include:

- **What is being waited on**
- **Who is responsible for the dependency** (team, role, vendor, etc.)
- **When the request was made**
- **What the expected turnaround is**

## 🧭 Ownership & Follow-Up

| Role                  | Responsibility                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Developer**         | Flags external dependency clearly and early         |
| **Scrum Master**      | Monitors status, ensures follow-ups and escalations |
| **Scope Lead**        | Escalates internally if blocking sprint work        |
| **Scope Coordinator** | Escalates outside the team or across domains        |

The person who identified the dependency is responsible for describing it clearly. The Scrum Master ensures it doesn’t go unaddressed.

## ⏱️ Follow-Up Guidelines

| Type                    | Follow-Up Timeframe            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Urgent/Blocking         | Daily follow-up until resolved |
| Important, not blocking | 48-hour check-in window        |
| Passive dependency      | Reviewed in Standup + Retro    |

Dependencies that span multiple sprints should be documented and reviewed every week.

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Raise dependencies as soon as they are known — not after they become blockers
- Be clear and factual — what is needed, by when, and from whom
- Maintain written records of all external requests
- Mention unresolved dependencies in Standup, Planning, and Review
- Close the loop — confirm once the dependency is resolved and unblock the work

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Keeping external requests in chat or email only
- Assuming someone else is following up
- Replanning around dependencies without surfacing them
- Letting open questions from outside teams stall sprint work silently

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if we don’t know who owns the dependency?**  
Raise it anyway — the Scrum Master or Scope Coordinator will help identify the right contact.

**Q: Should we track dependencies if they’re “not urgent”?**  
Yes. If it affects scope, order, or delivery risk, it must be visible — even if it’s not yet blocking.

**Q: Can we accept work into a sprint if it has an unresolved dependency?**  
Only if the dependency has a clear ETA and won’t block sprint completion. Otherwise, defer it until the next cycle.

**Q: How do we report or escalate unresolved blockers?**  
Mention them during Standup. If unresolved for 48 hours, Scrum Master and Scope Lead escalate internally or externally depending on the case.

Untracked dependencies become invisible risks.  
Track them clearly. Escalate early. Unblock confidently.
