# 📆 Sprint Cadence

The sprint cadence defines the recurring rhythm of ceremonies and working sessions that structure the team’s delivery flow. It ensures that planning, refinement, execution, and reflection happen consistently — enabling focus, predictability, and sustainable pace.

This cadence is fixed. The schedule does not shift based on sprint load or availability. If someone is unavailable for a session, they are responsible for staying informed and prepared.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Create rhythm and shared expectations across time zones
- Prevent chaos caused by ad hoc meetings or shifting priorities
- Ensure planning and refinement happen _before_ execution
- Allow the team to reflect and improve with each sprint

## ⏱️ Cadence Overview

The team operates on a **2-week sprint cycle**, starting every **Friday** and ending on the **Thursday two weeks later**.

All times are fixed and repeat every sprint.

## 📉 What Happens If We Break the Cadence?

> The cadence is not just a schedule — it’s a delivery system. When we skip or delay parts of it:

- 🔁 **No refinement** → unclear work enters the sprint
- 🧭 **Missed planning** → commitments don’t reflect capacity
- 🧪 **No review** → outcomes go unvalidated
- 📉 **No retrospective** → problems repeat and improvement stalls
- 📅 **Ad hoc meetings** → time zones drift, priorities scatter

🧠 The cadence exists to protect the team — not to slow it down.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Treat cadence slots as unmovable — don’t shift to accommodate incomplete prep
- Use refinement sessions to clarify work early — not to fill calendar space
- Respect each session’s intent — planning is for commitment, not writing
- Keep board status synced daily to avoid confusion during ceremonies

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if I’m unavailable for a required session?**  
Notify the team in advance and catch up on notes or shared outcomes. Absence doesn’t remove responsibility to stay aligned.

**Q: Can we reschedule ceremonies when the sprint gets busy?**  
No. The cadence is intentionally fixed. Skipping or shifting ceremonies introduces risk and undermines predictability.

**Q: What if we don’t have enough work ready for Planning?**  
That’s a refinement failure. Raise it early and use Strategic/Functional Refinement to prepare. Planning should never include work that isn’t ready.

**Q: Can we combine ceremonies to save time?**  
Only if flow, clarity, and outcome ownership are preserved. For example, Review + Retro is designed as a paired block — but Planning should never be merged with Refinement.

**Q: Why do we start the sprint on a Friday?**  
This structure allows a clean reset after ceremonies and enables the team to ease into focused work with small deliverables before the full sprint rhythm begins on Monday.
