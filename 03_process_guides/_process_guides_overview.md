# üîÅ Process System Overview

This document provides a high-level view of how delivery happens in practice ‚Äî not just what ceremonies exist, but how they fit together to support momentum, clarity, and accountability.

These processes are designed to support a lean but structured Scrum-like framework, adapted for remote collaboration, legacy system maintenance, and evolving priorities.

---

## üß≠ Purpose of Team Processes

Team processes exist to:

- Keep delivery aligned with real priorities
- Ensure work is understood before it begins
- Surface blockers before they create chaos
- Validate outcomes before calling anything ‚Äúdone‚Äù
- Continuously improve how the team works

Ceremonies aren‚Äôt the goal ‚Äî they‚Äôre tools that help the team stay focused, finish what was started, and build trust in each iteration.

## üîÑ Core Delivery Cycle

The team operates on a 2-week sprint cadence, broken into predictable loops:

### üî∏ 1. **Refinement**

Refinement happens in layers:

- **Strategic Refinement** defines and evolves Epics and Features
- **Functional Refinement** breaks Features into clear, testable User Stories
- **Tactical Refinement** breaks Stories into executable Tasks

These loops ensure the team never enters a sprint without clarity.

### üî∏ 2. **Sprint Planning**

Before each sprint starts, the team:

- Confirms capacity
- Selects ready User Stories
- Commits to a realistic and valuable goal

Work is planned at ~80% capacity to allow for support and unexpected blockers.

### üî∏ 3. **Daily Standup**

Every day, the team checks progress, raises blockers, and updates the board.  
Standup is fast, focused, and based on Tasks ‚Äî not storytelling.

### üî∏ 4. **Sprint Execution**

The team works from the board.  
Tasks move across: `Ready ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Review ‚Üí Done`.  
Blockers are escalated quickly, and WIP limits help reduce overload.

### üî∏ 5. **Sprint Review & Retrospective**

At the end of the sprint:

- Completed work is demoed and validated
- The team reflects on what helped or hindered progress
- Minor process improvements are identified and applied

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Escalation Handling

Blockers are not resolved privately or silently.  
The team follows a structured path:

- Blockers are raised in Standup
- Scrum Master facilitates resolution
- Scope Lead or Scope Coordinator steps in for cross-item or external issues

Unresolved issues are tracked in the backlog or on the status board until cleared.

---

## üìä WIP & Delivery Health

The team monitors basic delivery metrics to maintain flow:

- Velocity (per sprint)
- Cycle time (per item)
- Carryover rate
- Work type balance (project vs. support)

WIP limits and delivery metrics are lightweight ‚Äî intended to prompt reflection, not performance pressure.

---

## ü§ù Team Ownership

Every process exists to support the team ‚Äî not constrain it.

- The **Scrum Master** facilitates, but doesn‚Äôt own outcomes alone
- Each team member contributes to process clarity and delivery rhythm
- If something isn‚Äôt working, the team adapts ‚Äî but with structure and intent

## üìÖ Sprint Calendar Overview

The team follows a 2-week sprint cadence. Ceremonies are fixed to specific days and times to support focus, predictability, and cross-timezone alignment.

> ‚è±Ô∏è **Note:** All times are suggested defaults and may be adjusted by team consensus. The goal is consistency ‚Äî not rigidity.

Delivery is a system ‚Äî not a series of meetings. These processes help the team stay aligned, reduce waste, and deliver real outcomes with clarity and confidence.
