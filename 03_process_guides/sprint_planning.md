# 🧭 Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning defines what the team will deliver over the next 2 weeks. It ensures that work is selected intentionally, scoped realistically, and aligned with both capacity and goals.

This ceremony is the final preparation step before the sprint begins the following day.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Commit to a sprint goal the team can realistically deliver
- Select User Stories that are refined, sized, and ready
- Confirm capacity and account for non-project work
- Ensure shared understanding of the planned work

---

## ⏱️ Timing

- **When**: Last Thursday of the current sprint
- **Duration**: 1.5 hours
- **Cadence**: Every 2 weeks, immediately followed by Sprint Review
- **Participants**: Entire team (mandatory)

---

## 📦 Inputs

Planning should never start from scratch. Inputs must already be prepared:

- Refined, “Ready” User Stories (from Functional Refinement)
- Updated capacity (vacations, time off, known commitments)
- Visibility into non-project work (support, maintenance, spikes)
- Known priorities and delivery targets from Scope Coordinator/Product Owner

---

## 🔁 Planning Flow

1. **Set the context**  
   Scope Coordinator or Scrum Master restates current priorities and business goals.

2. **Confirm capacity**  
   The team discusses availability and adjusts for known constraints.  
   Target 80% capacity to leave room for blockers and support.

3. **Review candidate Stories**  
   Scope Lead presents refined Stories. Developers ask clarifying questions if needed.

4. **Estimate missing points (if applicable)**  
   Stories without estimates are discussed and sized.

5. **Select work**  
   The team pulls Stories into the sprint until capacity is reached.

6. **Confirm sprint goal**  
   Sprint Goal is either linked to a Feature or defined explicitly.

7. **Assign initial ownership**  
   Each Developer takes initial ownership of one or more Stories.

8. **End with alignment**  
   Board is updated. Everyone knows what to work on.  
   Sprint begins **the following day (Friday)** with Daily Standup.

---

## 🧪 Quality Rules

- Only **Ready** Stories are allowed into the sprint
- All Stories must have:
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Clear scope
  - Known dependencies
- Stories must be small enough to complete within a sprint
- No placeholder or speculative work is allowed

---

## 📊 Output

At the end of planning:

- Sprint board is populated with committed Stories
- Sprint Goal is visible and agreed upon
- Developers begin Tactical Refinement of assigned Stories
- Scrum Master verifies that nothing unclear has entered the sprint

---

## 🧠 Reminders

- Planning is about focus, not forecasting
- The right amount of work fits the team’s **real** capacity, not ideal velocity
- A well-scoped sprint starts strong — and finishes clean

---

Sprint Planning sets the tone for the next two weeks. It’s where clarity turns into commitment — preparing the team to begin focused, confident delivery at the start of the sprint the next day.
