# 📣 Daily Standup

The Daily Standup is a short, structured check-in that keeps the team aligned, surfaces blockers, and maintains momentum. It is not a status meeting — it’s a shared visibility loop focused on task-level execution.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Maintain awareness of progress and blockers
- Update the Scrum board based on actual status
- Identify delivery risks early
- Reinforce focus and accountability without micromanagement

---

## ⏱️ Timing

- **When**: Every working day
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Facilitator**: Scrum Master
- **Participants**: Entire team (mandatory)

---

## 🔁 Format

The meeting is guided by the Scrum board — not a fixed speaking order. The facilitator walks the board top-to-bottom or left-to-right (column-first), focusing on **Tasks** that are:

- In Progress
- Blocked
- Ready for Review
- Moving toward Done

Developers speak when their Task is discussed. The format avoids long updates or storytelling.

---

## 📌 Questions to Cover

- Is this item still accurate in status?
- Is anything blocked or unclear?
- Can this move forward today?

> 🧠 If something requires deeper discussion → take it offline  
> Standup is for visibility, not problem-solving

---

## 🚦 Blocker Protocol

- Any item in `Blocked` must be raised immediately
- Scrum Master helps triage and escalate as needed
- Blockers unresolved for more than 1 day must be flagged in the Retrospective

---

## 🧪 Quality Rules

- The board is updated **during** or **immediately before** Standup
- No item should sit in `In Progress` or `In Review` for more than a few days
- Tasks not actively moving forward should be moved back to `Ready` or `Blocked`
- Team members do **not** report on time spent — only on delivery progress

---

## 🧠 Reminders

- The goal is not to talk — the goal is to move work forward
- Silence on a blocked item slows everyone down
- Focus on **Tasks**, not feelings or opinions — problem-solving happens outside this space

---

A great Standup keeps the team moving — not just informed. It’s how work stays visible, issues stay small, and the sprint stays on track.
