# 🧩 Refinement Sessions

Refinement is how the team ensures that work is clear before it begins. It is not just backlog grooming — it is structured thinking that turns strategy into deliverable work.

This file defines the team’s three levels of refinement:

1. **Strategic Refinement** → shape Epics and Features
2. **Functional Refinement** → break Features into Stories
3. **Tactical Refinement** → turn Stories into executable Tasks

Each loop reduces uncertainty, aligns effort with value, and prevents chaos mid-sprint.

## 🧭 Why Refinement Matters

- Keeps the team focused on delivering the _right_ work
- Prevents vague, over-scoped, or rushed delivery
- Supports sustainable planning and stable velocity
- Builds trust — no one starts work they don’t understand

---

## 🔹 1. Strategic Refinement

### ✅ Purpose

Define and evolve Epics and Features to support strategic priorities.

### 🧩 Scope

- New Projects → converted into Epics
- New Epics → broken into meaningful Features
- Existing Epics/Features → reviewed for alignment, clarity, and sizing

### 🎯 Participants

- Scope Coordinator (facilitator)
- Scope Leads
- Scrum Master (optional, supports clarity)
- Product Owner (occasionally, for context or validation)

### ⏱️ Timing

- Every **Monday** during both sprint weeks
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Cadence**: Weekly, non-skippable

### 🛠️ Preparation

- Updated backlog
- Open questions or prioritization notes
- Any new business context from Product Owner

### 📦 Output

- Epics marked `Ready` with measurable outcomes
- Features sized and scoped for 1–2 sprints
- Misaligned or unclear items flagged or returned to `Draft`

### 🔧 Sample Questions

- Does this Epic have a defined outcome?
- Can this Feature be delivered within 1–2 sprints?
- Is this still aligned with current priorities?

### 📋 Readiness Checklist

For an **Epic** to be marked `Ready`:

- [ ] Linked to a Project with clear business context
- [ ] Describes a measurable outcome or milestone
- [ ] Sized for delivery across multiple sprints
- [ ] Has at least one proposed Feature
- [ ] Reviewed by Scope Coordinator and Scope Lead

For a **Feature** to be marked `Ready`:

- [ ] Supports a specific Epic
- [ ] Sized for delivery in 1–2 sprints
- [ ] Clearly defines goal, value, and scope
- [ ] Has no major unknowns or dependencies
- [ ] Reviewed and agreed upon by Scope Lead and Scope Coordinator

### ❓ Common Questions & Pitfalls (Strategic)

- _“Can we skip Strategic Refinement if priorities are clear?”_  
  → No. Even with clear intent, Epics and Features need structure, scope, and validation before being used.

- _“What if an Epic seems too broad to scope properly?”_  
  → Break it down by business outcome or user impact. A good Epic has a measurable end state — not just a theme.

- _“Why not go straight to building Stories?”_  
  → Without Epics/Features, there’s no alignment across sprints or strategic visibility. Stories become fragmented and reactive.

## 🔹 2. Functional Refinement

### ✅ Purpose

Break down Features into User Stories that are testable, estimable, and small enough to deliver within a sprint.

### 🧩 Scope

- Features that are `Ready` but not yet broken down
- Stories that require rework, clarification, or estimation

### 🎯 Participants

- Scope Lead (facilitator)
- Product Developers
- Product Analyst (for acceptance criteria and testability)
- Scrum Master (to ensure readiness discipline)

### ⏱️ Timing

- Every **Wednesday** during both sprint weeks
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Cadence**: Weekly, mandatory

### 🛠️ Preparation

- Candidate Features selected by Scope Lead
- Acceptance criteria examples or drafts
- Known constraints, data sources, or dependencies

### 📦 Output

- User Stories marked `Ready`
- Stories estimated or scheduled for estimation in Planning
- Non-ready items flagged for refinement backlog

### 🔧 Sample Questions

- What is the user need or business requirement?
- What does “done” look like for this Story?
- Is this small enough to finish in one sprint?

### 📋 Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Story has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Story is linked to a Feature
- [ ] Story has no open technical unknowns
- [ ] Story is feasible within a sprint

### ❓ Common Questions & Pitfalls (Functional)

- _“This Story is just a bullet point. Is that enough?”_  
  → No. Every Story needs context and acceptance criteria. If it can’t be tested, it’s not ready.

- _“Do we really need to write this down? We all know what it means.”_  
  → Refinement is for shared clarity — not individual memory. Clarity now prevents rework later.

- _“We didn’t finish refinement. Can we do it in Planning?”_  
  → Planning is for **selection**, not writing or defining Stories. If it’s not refined before, it doesn’t go in.

## 🔹 3. Tactical Refinement

### ✅ Purpose

Break accepted User Stories into clear, day-sized Tasks that can be executed immediately.

### 🧩 Scope

- Stories selected during Sprint Planning

### 🎯 Participants

- Product Developers (solo or in pairs)
- Scrum Master (checks that breakdown happens)

### ⏱️ Timing

- **Immediately after Sprint Planning**
- **Duration**: 30 minutes per developer (self-managed)
- **Cadence**: Every sprint

### 🛠️ Preparation

- Accepted User Stories
- Personal sprint capacity and focus
- Known implementation patterns

### 📦 Output

- Each Story has 2–5 Tasks
- Tasks are clearly named and described
- Status of each Task starts at `Ready`

### 🔧 Sample Questions

- What are the smallest meaningful steps for this Story?
- Can each Task be completed in one day or less?
- Is anything blocked or still unclear?

### 📋 Task Checklist

- [ ] Task has a descriptive title
- [ ] Task fits within one workday
- [ ] Task contains inputs or references
- [ ] Task is linked to a Story

### ❓ Common Questions & Pitfalls (Tactical)

- _“Do I really need to break this down if I know how to do it?”_  
  → Yes. Clear Tasks reduce mental load, support flow, and help others track progress.

- _“I’m halfway through, but the Task isn’t done. Should I update status?”_  
  → If it’s not complete, it stays `In Progress`. Don’t hide uncertainty — surface it early.

- _“I forgot to break down my Story after Planning. Is it too late?”_  
  → Break it down before starting work. Tactical Refinement is how you avoid scope creep during delivery.

## 🔁 Summary Table

| Level      | Goal                                | Facilitator          | Output                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Strategic  | Epics & Features aligned and scoped | Scope Coordinator    | `Ready` Epics & Features      |
| Functional | Stories clarified and testable      | Scope Lead           | `Ready` User Stories          |
| Tactical   | Tasks are actionable and clear      | Developer (self-led) | `Ready` Tasks linked to Story |

## 🧠 Reminders

- Refinement is how the team reduces risk _before_ it shows up mid-sprint
- If refinement is skipped, planning suffers — and delivery stumbles
- Each level builds on the last — don’t jump ahead

---

Refinement is quiet work that prevents loud chaos.  
It’s not overhead — it’s how the team works smarter, not harder.
