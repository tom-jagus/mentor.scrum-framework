# 📊 WIP Limits & Delivery Metrics

WIP limits and delivery metrics help the team protect flow, reduce overload, and improve predictability over time. These are not performance tools — they are feedback mechanisms.

> 📌 Metrics should inform decisions, not drive pressure. WIP limits should reduce friction, not slow momentum.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Focus work on what matters most
- Reduce multitasking, context switching, and invisible work
- Identify blockers or unhealthy sprint patterns early
- Improve sprint planning and forecasting through team-owned data

---

## 🚧 WIP = Work in Progress

WIP is any work that has started but isn’t yet done.  
The more WIP a team juggles, the more:

- Context is lost
- Things get delayed
- Risks go unnoticed

## 🔢 WIP Limit Guidelines

| Level             | Default WIP Limit                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Per Developer** | 2 User Stories `In Progress` max                     |
| **Per Story**     | 5 open Tasks max (unless intentionally parallelized) |
| **Per Sprint**    | Avoid exceeding 80% planned capacity on project work |

> ✅ These are _defaults_, not hard constraints — but exceeding them should trigger a conversation.

---

## 🔁 How to Monitor WIP

- Use the Scrum board daily
- Scrum Master flags WIP violations in Standup
- Retrospective is used to discuss patterns and team-defined adjustments
- If WIP is always at the limit, revisit Story size or planning scope

## 📈 Key Delivery Metrics

| Metric              | What It Tells Us                                       | Who Uses It                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Velocity**        | Total story points (or Stories) delivered per sprint   | Scrum Master, Scope Coordinator |
| **Cycle Time**      | Avg. time from `In Progress` to `Done`                 | Scrum Master, Team              |
| **Carryover Rate**  | Stories not finished within sprint                     | Scrum Master                    |
| **Work Type Ratio** | Balance of project work vs. support, maintenance, bugs | Scrum Master, Product Owner     |

> These metrics are most useful when reviewed **monthly** and discussed in Retrospective — not as dashboards to “check.”

## 🔍 Examples of Healthy WIP & Metrics Behavior

- Team finishes all planned Stories by Thursday, begins Tactical Refinement early
- Only one Story is actively being developed per Developer
- Carryover happens occasionally, but not repeatedly from the same contributor or Story type
- Support Tasks are visible and estimated — not invisible “extra work”

## 🚩 Common Pitfalls

| Symptom                       | Possible Root Cause                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| High WIP, low completion      | Too many Stories started at once                |
| Frequent carryover            | Stories too big or not truly “Ready”            |
| Low velocity, high time spent | Excessive non-project work not tracked properly |
| Many Tasks in `Blocked`       | Missing upstream refinement or external input   |

---

## 🧠 Reminders

- Metrics help the team see patterns — they’re not about tracking individuals
- WIP limits are there to encourage conversations — not punish progress
- Talk about metrics in Retrospectives, not as judgment — but as fuel for improvement

---

Limiting WIP keeps the team focused.  
Measuring flow helps the team adapt.  
Neither works without trust and transparency.
