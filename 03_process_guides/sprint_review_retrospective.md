# 🔍 Sprint Review & Retrospective

This session closes the sprint. It’s split into two parts:

1. **Sprint Review** — validate what was delivered
2. **Retrospective** — reflect on how the sprint went

It ensures the team doesn’t just finish work — it learns from it.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Demonstrate completed User Stories
- Confirm that work meets the agreed Definition of Done
- Gather feedback and insights from delivery outcomes
- Reflect on blockers, breakdowns, and improvements
- Build shared understanding of what’s working — and what’s not

---

## ⏱️ Timing

- **When**: Last Thursday of the sprint (after Sprint Planning)
- **Duration**: 1 hour (45 min Review + 15 min Retrospective)
- **Participants**: Entire team + Product Owner
- **Facilitator**: Scrum Master

---

## 🔁 Format

### 🔸 Part 1 — Sprint Review

1. **Set the context**  
   Scrum Master restates the Sprint Goal and Feature (if applicable)

2. **Demo the work**  
   Scope Lead presents each completed User Story  
   Developers may contribute or answer implementation questions

3. **Validate and confirm**  
   Product Analyst confirms acceptance criteria were met  
   Product Owner validates outcomes align with intended value

4. **Log feedback**  
   Notes are captured for missed expectations, rework, or follow-ups

---

### 🔸 Part 2 — Retrospective

1. **Quick check-in**  
   What helped? What slowed us down?

2. **Raise patterns**  
   Any repeated blockers, confusion, or process pain points?

3. **Identify 1–2 improvements**  
   Scrum Master or team proposes specific, actionable process changes

> ⏱️ Keep it focused. The goal is not therapy — it’s momentum.  
> Improvements should be small, specific, and testable in the next sprint.

## 📦 Output

By the end of the session:

- Work has been demonstrated and validated
- Feedback is logged or triaged
- Process improvement items are captured
- The sprint is officially closed

---

## 🧪 Quality Rules

- Only work in `Done` is demoed — no partial or “almost finished” Stories
- Bugs or rework uncovered during Review must be logged separately
- Retrospective feedback must be concrete — not just vibes
- Improvements are added to the board as Tasks or checklist items

---

## 🧠 Reminders

- This session is about **outcomes**, not just outputs
- The goal is to finish with shared clarity — not just mark work complete
- If nothing improves, velocity becomes the only metric — and that’s not the point

---

Done means demonstrated. Done means validated.  
This ceremony is how the team closes the loop — and makes the next sprint better than the last.
