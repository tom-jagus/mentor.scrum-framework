# 📘 Scrum Documentation System

This documentation system defines and supports the daily workflows, responsibilities, and agile practices of a globally distributed data and reporting team. It is the product of iterative design based on internal experience, structured Scrum principles, and cross-functional needs.

Its purpose is to serve as a modular, role-based, and evolving source of truth for:

- Defining each role’s expectations and scope
- Documenting and standardizing ceremonies and delivery processes
- Providing working templates, checklists, and practical guides
- Answering implementation questions and removing ambiguity

> 📌 This documentation is derived from an internal blueprint but is intended to stand independently for onboarding, operations, and continual improvement.
> Check the [[blueprint]]

## 🔹 Scrum Framework Summary

The delivery model defined in this documentation is a **Scrum-like agile framework**, adapted for:

- Legacy Power BI reporting environments
- Cross-timezone, asynchronous collaboration
- High volumes of maintenance, support, and project work

Key concepts include:

- A **6-role team structure** with clarified ownership via RACI
- A work item breakdown: **Project → Epic → Feature → Story**/**Bug** → **Task**
- Strong emphasis on **backlog health** and refinement ceremonies
- Dedicated ceremonies for **strategic, functional, and tactical** refinement
- Built-in support for **non-project work**, metrics, and WIP management
- External escalation processes and clearly defined governance boundaries
