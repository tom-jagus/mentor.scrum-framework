# 🌀 Modular Scrum Framework

This repository documents a lightweight, structured, and adaptable Scrum-inspired framework. It is designed to bring **clarity**, **accountability**, and **delivery rhythm** to teams of all types — from product development to process improvement and beyond.

The framework is modular, role-neutral, and easy to adopt — whether you're forming a new agile team or improving how existing work gets done.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This system exists to:

- Provide clear roles and responsibilities
- Define and govern work items from strategy to execution
- Establish consistent, focused ceremonies
- Support delivery with lightweight but essential processes
- Enable continuous improvement through refinement and review

It prioritizes **shared understanding**, **just enough structure**, and **team-owned delivery flow**.

## 🧱 What This Includes

- Clear role definitions — from strategic ownership to delivery execution
- Hierarchical work items — with defined lifecycle, ownership, and quality gates
- Ceremonies with intent — planning, review, standups, and three-layer refinement
- Processes that protect flow — escalation handling, backlog health, external dependencies, and more
- Guides to support focus — structured templates for refinement at different planning levels

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're onboarding or rolling this out to a team:

1. Start with \_roles_overview.md and \_work_items_overview.md
2. Review the \_ceremonies_overview.md to understand delivery rhythm
3. Browse the \_processes_overview.md for operational clarity
4. Use the guides in 05_guides/ for deeper support in key practices

This structure is intentionally lean — it grows with your needs, not before them.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

This framework is built on:

- Understanding before execution
- Clarity over cleverness
- Simplicity with structure
- Reusable documentation
- Scalable, maintainable practices

It reflects real-world use and is meant to evolve as your team does.
