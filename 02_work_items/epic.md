# 🧩 Epic

An **Epic** represents a major outcome, milestone, or capability required to fulfill a Project. It breaks down a strategic initiative into structured, deliverable themes — typically composed of multiple Features across sprints.

Epics serve as the bridge between strategic intent and tactical planning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Define a meaningful outcome supporting a Project
- Provide structure for organizing Features and Stories
- Enable medium-term planning (1–3 months)
- Track progress toward larger business goals

---

## 👤 Ownership

- **Primary Owner**: Scope Coordinator
- **Supports**: Scope Leads, Product Owner

Scope Coordinators are responsible for maintaining Epic clarity, ensuring alignment with Projects, and validating readiness before Features are scoped.

---

## 📐 Characteristics

- Represents a mid-range goal achievable within 1–3 months
- Breaks down into multiple Features that can be delivered in 1–2 sprints each
- Anchored to a strategic Project
- Describes outcomes, not activities

---

## ✏️ Writing Good Epics

### 🔹 Core Principles

- Focus on **outcomes** — what value will be unlocked when this is complete?
- Avoid vague categories like “phase,” “stream,” or “workstream”
- Avoid using a Feature-level label for an Epic
- Be specific about who benefits and how

### ✅ Good Examples

- “Enable role-based access to all SLA dashboards”
- “Establish real-time reporting infrastructure for global operations”

### ❌ Bad Examples

- “SLA workstream Q2”
- “Dashboards migration – Phase 2”

## 🔁 Status Lifecycle

| Status             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Draft`            | Initial concept under early consideration                   |
| `Needs Refinement` | Outcome or scope not yet clearly defined                    |
| `Ready`            | Outcome, purpose, and scope validated and linked to Project |
| `In Progress`      | Features are being delivered against this Epic              |
| `Complete`         | All Features delivered, Epic goal achieved                  |

## ✅ Readiness Checklist

An Epic is considered **Ready** when:

- [ ] It is linked to a validated Project
- [ ] Describes a clear, measurable outcome
- [ ] Purpose and scope are well defined
- [ ] Sized for delivery across 1–3 months
- [ ] Contains at least one draft or defined Feature
- [ ] Reviewed and approved by Scope Coordinator and Scope Lead

---

## 🏁 Completion Checklist

An Epic may be marked **Complete** when:

- [ ] All associated Features are delivered
- [ ] The defined business outcome has been achieved or re-evaluated
- [ ] No additional work is planned under this scope
- [ ] Closure is confirmed by Scope Coordinator

---

## 🧭 Planning Behavior

- Epics are used in Strategic Refinement and roadmap-level planning
- Sprint planning is driven by Features and Stories _within_ Epics
- Epics are referenced during prioritization and progress reporting
- Epics must remain current and reviewed regularly

---

## 🔍 Board & Visibility

- Epics are not managed directly on the Scrum board
- Visibility is maintained through linked Features and Stories
- Scope Coordinators track Epic progress through Feature status
- Teams may use filters, tags, or Epic views to review scope progress

---

Epics connect strategy to structure.  
They give delivery its direction — and make big outcomes manageable.
