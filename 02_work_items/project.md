# 📦 Project

A **Project** represents a strategic business challenge, initiative, or opportunity. It is the highest-level work item in the team’s hierarchy and acts as the anchor for long-term value delivery. Projects define _why_ something needs to be done — not _how_ it will be built.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Capture strategic business intent
- Align delivery around measurable outcomes
- Group related Epics under a shared goal
- Prioritize work based on impact and urgency

---

## 👤 Ownership

- **Primary Owner**: Product Owner
- **Supports**: Scope Coordinator, Scope Leads

Only the Product Owner can create, approve, or close a Project. Input may come from leadership, business stakeholders, or long-range planning initiatives.

---

## 📐 Characteristics

- Represents a strategic direction or high-value outcome
- Typically spans months of work and multiple Epics
- Guides prioritization and alignment without micro-managing details
- Serves as a unifying “why” behind lower-level delivery items

---

## ✏️ Writing Good Projects

### 🔹 Core Principles

- Focus on business outcomes, not implementation goals
- Be specific about the opportunity or challenge
- Avoid vague terms like “improvement,” “cleanup,” or “effort”
- Think in terms of value: _Who benefits? In what way?_

### ✅ Good Examples

- “Enable self-service SLA reporting for regional managers”
- “Establish baseline cost metrics for incident response processes”

### ❌ Bad Examples

- “Reporting improvements Q3”
- “Ops dashboard redesign + cleanup”

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Draft`       | High-level idea or business problem under early consideration |
| `Proposed`    | Under review by Product Owner for validation and alignment    |
| `Approved`    | Validated and ready for breakdown into Epics                  |
| `In Progress` | One or more Epics actively delivering against this Project    |
| `Complete`    | Business goal met; all work delivered and validated           |

## ✅ Readiness Checklist

A Project is considered **Ready** when:

- [ ] Business problem or opportunity is clearly defined
- [ ] Value or outcome is measurable or observable
- [ ] Initiative aligns with strategic goals or themes
- [ ] At least one Epic is proposed or in scoping
- [ ] Approved by Product Owner to move forward

---

## 🏁 Completion Checklist

A Project may be marked **Complete** when:

- [ ] All related Epics are delivered and closed
- [ ] Business outcome has been met or re-evaluated
- [ ] No further Features are expected under this scope
- [ ] Closure confirmed by Product Owner

---

## 🧭 Planning Behavior

- Projects are **not** managed within sprints
- They inform prioritization at the Epic and Feature level
- Strategic Refinement sessions use Projects as context and alignment references
- Scope Coordinators ensure Epics are always traceable back to a Project

---

## 🔍 Board & Visibility

- Projects do **not** appear on the Scrum board
- Progress is inferred through status of linked Epics and Features
- Backlog views and reporting tools group and track delivery under Projects
- Projects must remain visible and up to date for roadmap and prioritization purposes

---

Projects define the “why” behind delivery — giving purpose, direction, and alignment to everything beneath them.
