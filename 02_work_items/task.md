# 🔧 Task

A **Task** is the smallest unit of tracked work. Tasks represent a single, actionable step required to complete a User Story. Each Task is specific, assigned, and scoped to one day or less.

Tasks allow the team to execute predictably, reduce cognitive load, and maintain visible progress throughout the sprint.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Break down User Stories into small, executable steps
- Enable focused daily work with minimal ambiguity
- Track delivery flow and surface blockers early
- Ensure clear ownership and traceability from Story to execution

---

## 👤 Ownership

- **Primary Owner**: Product Developer

Each Developer is responsible for creating, updating, and delivering their own Tasks. Task refinement happens immediately after Sprint Planning.

---

## 📐 Characteristics

- Scoped to a maximum of one working day
- Describes exactly one action or outcome
- Linked to a single User Story
- Moves independently across the Scrum board
- Assigned to a specific Developer at the start of the sprint

---

## ✏️ Writing Good Tasks

### 🔹 Core Principles

- Use action verbs and name the output
- Focus on _what needs to be done_, not why or how
- Avoid bundling — one task = one unit of progress
- Be consistent in naming for traceability and readability

### ✅ Good Examples

- “Build parser for SLA input field”
- “Add export button to incident summary UI”
- “Write unit test for missing timestamp case”

### ❌ Bad Examples

- “Do export logic”
- “Fix stuff in metrics pipeline”
- “Handle problems with SLA”

## 🔁 Status Lifecycle

| Status        | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Ready`       | Fully defined, sprint-ready                 |
| `In Progress` | Actively being worked on                    |
| `Blocked`     | Cannot proceed — dependency or issue exists |
| `In Review`   | Work complete — pending verification        |
| `Done`        | Validated and confirmed complete            |

## ✅ Readiness Checklist

A Task is considered **Ready** when:

- [ ] It is linked to a Story
- [ ] Clearly describes a single action or unit of work
- [ ] Fits within one day of focused effort
- [ ] Assigned to a Developer
- [ ] Starts in the `Ready` column at sprint kickoff

---

## 🏁 Completion Checklist

A Task may be marked **Done** when:

- [ ] The work is complete and tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Any required output or artifact is delivered
- [ ] The Task has been reviewed (if needed)
- [ ] Its status is updated on the Scrum board

---

## 🧭 Planning Behavior

- Tasks are created during **Tactical Refinement** immediately after Sprint Planning
- Developers create their own Tasks for assigned Stories
- Scrum Master ensures all Stories are broken into Tasks before execution begins
- Tasks are not redefined mid-sprint unless scope changes

---

## 🔍 Board & Visibility

- Tasks are visible and updated daily on the team board
- Flow must be accurate — `In Progress`, `Blocked`, and `In Review` reflect real status
- Scrum Master monitors WIP at the Task level
- Tasks are the heartbeat of daily Standup

---

Tasks are how plans become progress — simple, focused, and owned.
