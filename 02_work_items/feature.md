# 🎯 Feature

A **Feature** defines a specific, deliverable milestone or capability that contributes to an Epic. It serves as the primary planning unit for short-term execution — typically delivered in 1–2 sprints — and represents a coherent, user-facing improvement or functional outcome.

Features help the team align on _what_ to build and _why_, without dropping into implementation details.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Translate Epics into short-term, actionable units of value
- Group related User Stories under a shared delivery goal
- Provide structure for sprint-level planning and prioritization
- Serve as the anchor for Functional Refinement

---

## 👤 Ownership

- **Primary Owner**: Scope Coordinator
- **Supports**: Scope Lead, Product Owner

Scope Coordinators are responsible for ensuring Features are aligned with Epic outcomes and properly scoped for execution by the team.

---

## 📐 Characteristics

- Represents a valuable outcome achievable in 1–2 sprints
- Often reflects a new capability, workflow, UI enhancement, or service function
- Provides context and clarity to support Story creation and refinement
- Can be tracked and demoed at the sprint or Epic level

---

## ✏️ Writing Good Features

### 🔹 Core Principles

- Focus on functionality or visible progress — avoid internal or vague wording
- Think in terms of _what will be usable or different_ once this Feature is delivered
- Avoid implementation jargon like “backend update,” “refactor,” or “support work”
- Size to match team capacity across no more than two sprints

### ✅ Good Examples

- “Add SLA thresholds and compliance flags to KPI dashboard”
- “Implement export tool for incident breach report as downloadable CSV”

### ❌ Bad Examples

- “SLA logic updates”
- “Finish report export backend changes”

## 🔁 Status Lifecycle

| Status                | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Draft`               | Concept identified, but value or scope unclear      |
| `Needs Clarification` | Scope or outcome not yet validated                  |
| `Ready`               | Fully defined, validated, and aligned with an Epic  |
| `In Progress`         | User Stories under this Feature are being delivered |
| `Complete`            | All Stories delivered; Feature goal achieved        |

## ✅ Readiness Checklist

A Feature is considered **Ready** when:

- [ ] It supports a defined Epic
- [ ] Goal, scope, and value are clearly documented
- [ ] Sized to be delivered within 1–2 sprints
- [ ] No major unknowns or blockers exist
- [ ] Accepted by Scope Lead for Functional Refinement

---

## 🏁 Completion Checklist

A Feature may be marked **Complete** when:

- [ ] All User Stories linked to this Feature are complete
- [ ] Intended functionality has been delivered and validated
- [ ] Feature value is demonstrated or presented in Review
- [ ] Closure confirmed by Scope Coordinator and Scope Lead

---

## 🧭 Planning Behavior

- Features are the primary unit for **Functional Refinement**
- Selected Features inform what Stories are refined and prioritized
- Each Feature should generate enough Stories to fill a sprint (or two)
- Sprint scope must always tie back to a Feature for visibility and tracking

---

## 🔍 Board & Visibility

- Features are not managed on the sprint board directly
- Tracked through related Stories that appear on the board
- Feature status is updated based on Story completion
- Can be used in dashboards or filters for Epic-level progress tracking

---

Features define _what_ we’re building next — not just to fill a sprint, but to move real value forward.
