# 🧱 Work Items Overview

This section defines the structure, purpose, and lifecycle of all work items used by the team — from high-level Projects to granular Tasks. It exists to ensure every item has a clear owner, meaning, and place in the delivery flow.

Work items are the foundation of planning, tracking, and executing work. Each level serves a distinct purpose, enabling the team to move from strategic goals to daily execution with clarity and control.

## 📐 Hierarchy

The team uses a structured hierarchy to break work down across six levels:

| Level | Work Item      | Purpose                                                                   | Primary Owner     |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1     | **Project**    | Defines the business challenge or opportunity driving high-level outcomes | Product Owner     |
| 2     | **Epic**       | Represents major deliverables aligned to a Project                        | Scope Coordinator |
| 3     | **Feature**    | Groups related functionality or milestones under an Epic                  | Scope Coordinator |
| 4     | **User Story** | Describes a stakeholder need or functional unit of delivery               | Scope Lead        |
| 5     | **Bug**        | Captures a defect impacting expected functionality                        | Product Developer |
| 6     | **Task**       | Represents a concrete, actionable step toward implementing a Story        | Product Developer |

Each item type is defined and governed separately to support clarity, planning, and accountability across the team.

## 🧭 Ownership & Accountability

Work items are not created in isolation. Each one has a clear **owner** and must serve a defined purpose:

- **Projects** are strategic — owned by the Product Owner
- **Epics** and **Features** are planning layers — shaped by the Scope Coordinator
- **User Stories** are execution-ready — refined and owned by Scope Leads
- **Tasks** are the team’s daily focus — driven by Product Developers
- **Bugs** require fast response — co-owned by Developers and Analysts

Work items that are unowned, unclear, or stale are flagged during ceremonies and addressed as part of ongoing backlog health.

---

## 🔁 Lifecycle & Status

Each work item follows a defined set of statuses that reflect its lifecycle — from initial concept to delivery. These statuses:

- Make work visible on the board
- Clarify what’s ready, in progress, or blocked
- Enable better forecasting and delivery flow

Statuses are unique per work item type, but all follow a shared pattern of:  
`Draft` → `Ready` → `In Progress` → `In Review` → `Done` (or equivalent stages)

---

## 📊 Work Visibility

All work is tracked on the team board and included in sprint planning, standups, and reviews. Scrum board columns reflect common delivery states:

- `To Do` → `In Progress` → `Blocked` → `In Review` → `Done`

Work items must always reflect their true status — this ensures accountability, prevents confusion, and supports effective delivery monitoring.

---

## ✅ Quality Gates

Each work item type has a checklist that defines what makes it “ready” to start or “done” at completion. These quality gates:

- Prevent vague or premature planning
- Ensure delivery expectations are clear
- Enable reliable sprint commitment

No item should move forward without meeting its defined readiness checklist.

---

## 🧪 Bugs & Exceptions

Bugs are first-class work items — tracked, prioritized, and reviewed just like User Stories.  
They must follow their own workflow, include clear documentation, and be validated before resolution.

---

## 🔄 Non-Project Work

Not all valuable work falls within a formal Project. Maintenance, support, ad hoc tasks, and exploratory efforts are tracked as work items and properly classified.

These items are estimated, assigned, and reviewed like all other work to maintain transparency and delivery balance.

---

This structure enables the team to move from long-term initiatives to day-to-day execution with transparency, clarity, and control — across every role and scope of work.
